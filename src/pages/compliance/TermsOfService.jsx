            4. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION
          </Heading>
          <Text margin='1em'>
            4.1 Definition. “Confidential Information” means non-public business
            information, know-how, and trade secrets in any form, including
            information regarding product plans, Beta Versions, and any other
            information a reasonable person should understand to be
            confidential, which is disclosed by or on behalf of either party or
            its Affiliates to the other party or its Affiliates, directly or
            indirectly, in writing, orally, or by inspection of tangible
            objects, and whether such information is disclosed before or after
            the Effective Date of this Agreement. Confidential Information
            includes this Agreement and its terms. “Confidential Information”
            excludes information that (a) is publicly known and made generally
            available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by
            the disclosing party through no action or inaction of the receiving
            party; (b) is already in the possession of the receiving party at
            the time of disclosure by the disclosing party, as shown by the
            receiving party’s files and records; (c) is obtained by the
            receiving party from a third party without a breach of the third
            party’s obligations of confidentiality; or (d) is independently
            developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the
            disclosing party’s Confidential Information, as shown by documents
            and other competent evidence in the receiving party’s possession.
          </Text>
          <Text margin='1em'>
            4.2 Maintenance of Confidentiality. The party receiving Confidential
            Information hereunder agrees to take reasonable steps, at least
            substantially equivalent to the steps it takes to protect its own
            proprietary information, but not less than reasonable care, to
            prevent the unauthorized duplication or disclosure of the
            Confidential Information to third parties without the disclosing
            party’s prior written consent. The receiving party may disclose the
            disclosing party’s Confidential Information to the receiving party’s
            employees or agents who reasonably need to have access to such
            information to perform the receiving party’s obligations under this
            Agreement, and who will treat such Confidential Information under
            the terms of this Agreement. The receiving party may disclose the
            disclosing party’s Confidential Information if required by law so
            long as the receiving party gives the disclosing party written
            notice of the requirement prior to the disclosure (where permitted)
            and reasonable assistance, at the disclosing party’s expense, in
            limiting disclosure or obtaining an order protecting the information
            from public disclosure.
          </Text>
          <Text margin='1em'>
            4.3 Return of Materials and Effect of Termination. Upon written
            request of the disclosing party, or in any event upon any
            termination or expiration of this Agreement, the receiving party
            will return to the disclosing party or destroy all materials, in any
            medium, to the extent containing or reflecting any of the disclosing
            party’s Confidential Information. Following expiration or
            termination of this Agreement, we may purge your Your Data and your
            Service environment from our systems. The obligations in this
            section survive for three years following expiration or termination
            of this Agreement, except that Confidential Information that
            constitutes a trade secret of the disclosing party will continue to
            be subject to the terms of this section for as long as such
            information remains a trade secret under applicable law.

            9.1 Third-Party Products. Any third-party product that is made
            available in connection with the Service (e.g., a Non-Collab App) is
            provided pursuant to the terms of the applicable third-party
            agreement, and your use of any such third-party product constitutes
            your agreement to comply with the terms of the applicable
            third-party agreement. We assume no responsibility for, and
            specifically disclaim any liability or obligation with respect to,

            9.2 Non-Collab Apps. “Non-Collab App” means a software application
            developed by a third party or by you that interoperates with the
            Service or Client Software and that may be listed in the Collab
            repository. We do not warrant or support Non-Collab Apps, regardless
            of whether the Non-Collab App is listed in the Collab repository. If
            you install or enable a Non-Collab App for use with the Service, you
            grant us permission to allow the provider of that Non-Collab App to
            access Your Data as required for the interoperation of that Non-
            Collab App with the Service and/or Client Software. We are not
            responsible for any disclosure, modification, or deletion of Your
            Data by the Non-Collab provider resulting from access by a
            Non-Collab App. If we believe a Non-Collab App violates our
            policies, this Agreement, applicable law, or the rights of any third
            party, we may disable the Non-Collab App and suspend use of the
            Non-Collab App until the potential violation is resolved.
